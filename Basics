OOPS:
"Object technology is at its core the combination of four ideas: a structuring method, a
reliability discipline, an epistemological principle and a classification technique".

Structure:
  The structuring method applies to software decomposition and reuse.

            software decomposition and reuse

  Decomposition: Process of breaking down the something complex into simpler and manageable one. 
  Software decomposition : software decomposition is a process of beaking down the system into simpler and manageble modules or components,
                           simplifying the design, development, testing, and maintenance of the software system. 

Reliability :

  what is reliability? , reliability something we can trust , that it will do what is suppose to do, without unexpected failures.
  
  Reliability discipline : is a approach/ablity of software system do what is suppose to do , without unexpected failures.

Epistemological principle:

  Its a idea of describing an object by its external feature rather than internal working and implementation.
  
  This principle asks a question , how do we describe a classes ?
  
  In object technology object is descibed by its class , what we can do with it(features).
  
  Example: Sort() is a class , where sort object  describes that we can do sorting activity using this class , here the internal working and implementation is 
  not described rather its gives a general and external feature that this object do sorting.
  
  Abstraction , modularity , encapsulation cover these area.

Classification technique:

Classification technique is process of organizing and categorizing the object in a hierarchies based on their characteristics and behaviors.
This helps in managing and structuring complex system by grouping related objects together.
InHeritance cover these area.
